# Overview

Scripts and functions to process the open grants data and help feed it into Elasticsearch.

# Package dependencies

* `magrittr`
* `rvest`
* `httr`
* `here`
* `elastic`
* `readr`

# File listing

* `example_retrieve-pdf.R` - commented script demo-ing the functions to read in the opengrants.csv data table and resolve individual links into PDF streams
* `retrieve_pdf.R` - function definitions to resolve links into PDF streams

# TODO

* deal with grants entries with multiple links:
  - this currently gets output with commas at https://expanding-open-grants.github.io/ogrants/opengrants.csv, which causes some problems reading the data in
  - potentially resolved by fixing the Liquid syntax in `{repo root}/opengrants.csv`, or by reading in the output csv file and processing it better
* integrating this with the `elastic` R package
  - some glue code already exists in the `docker` branch of this repo
  - probably some modifications are necessary to incorporate more of the metadata fields from the csv file into Elasticsearch correctly
  - wrapping the individual function calls into a loop to generate the initial data for Elasticsearch
  - future-proofing by caching data and/or automating the lookup of new entries
