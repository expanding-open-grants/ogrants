An increasing number of researchers are sharing their grant proposals openly.
They do this to open up science so that all stages of the process can benefit from better interaction and communication and to provide examples for early career scientists writing grants.
This is a list of some of these proposals to help you find them.

This site runs on Jekyll using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme built on Poole.
It is developed on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This site started in 2012 as a [blog post](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/) on [Jabberwocky Ecology](https://jabberwocky.weecology.org/).
In 2017 [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) built the original version of the current site to make it easier for others to contribute and submit grants.

Development of this site is supported by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/)'s [Data-Driven Discovery Initiation](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=data-driven-discovery) through [Grant GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF4563) to Ethan White.
