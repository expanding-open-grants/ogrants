# Open Grants List

[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weecology/ogrants.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weecology/ogrants)

The Open Grants List is a list of grants that are openly available on the web.
These grants can help with learning grantsmanship, understanding particular funders and their programs, and communicating science.

The main website is <https://www.ogrants.org/>.

This is the Jekyll repository that creates the site.

## Adding a grant

Adding a grant to the list requires two (or three) things:

### 1. Post the grant online

This site doesn't host grants, it just provides links to them.
We recommend [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) as good options for posting grants because they are archival and so shouldn't result in broken links anytime in the near future.

### 2. Add information about the grant

Information for each grant is stored as YAML with fields for each key piece of information.
E.g.,

```markdown
---
layout: grant
title: Moore Investigator in Data Driven Discovery
author: Ethan P. White
ORCID: 0000-0001-6728-7745
year: 2014
link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1189330
funder: Moore Foundation
program: Data Driven Discovery Investigators
discipline: data science
status: funded
---
```

The items to the right of the `:` on each line should be changed to match the grant you want to add.
To get this added to the site there are three options:

1. Submit a pull request that adds the above information to a file named `lastname_firstname_year.md` in the `_grants` folder of the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}).
  The `lastname` and `firstname` should be those for the lead PI.
  In the case of multiple grants by the same PI for the same year append letters in order to the date, e.g., `white_ethan_2026a.md`.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/weecology/ogrants/issues/new) and paste the filled out YAML into that issue.
3. [Email us](mailto:ogrants@weecology.org) the information.

### 3. Add information about the author

If you want you can also add information about the author in the form:

```markdown
---
name: Ethan P. White
ORCID: 0000-0001-6728-7745
institution: University of Florida
website: http://ethanwhite.org
twitter: ethanwhite
---
```

This can be submitted along with the grant information if you're using an issue or email.
If you're submitting a pull request it should be placed in a file named `lastname_firstname.md` in the `_authors` directory.

## Developments

### Local Elasticsearch in a container

Docs/Notes:

- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html
- Using the OSS version
- Using `7.7.1` because [7.x is the latest supported version on AWS ES service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-elasticsearch-service.html).

```bash
docker build --tag ogrants .
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" ogrants
```

## Build locally

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
